# Virtual Corporate Finance Seminars

In early 2020 due to Covid-19, some of us were concerned about the potential impact on academic seminars and conferences in corporate finance. As a result Gordon Phillips (Dartmouth), Max Maksimovic (Maryland) and I created a virtual weekly seminar series for corporate finance. It started May 2020. More than 40 papers have been presented so far. We currently have seminar scheduled through May 18, 2022. To see a list of both the forthcoming and the past seminars (mostly with links to papers):
