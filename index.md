# Virtual Corporate Finance Seminars

In early 2020 due to Covid-19, some of us were concerned about the potential impact on academic seminars and conferences in corporate finance. As a result [Gordon Phillips (Dartmouth)](http://faculty.tuck.dartmouth.edu/gordon-phillips/), [Max Maksimovic (Maryland)](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/vojislav-max-maksimovic) and I, created a virtual weekly seminar series for corporate finance. It started May 2020. Many papers have been presented so far, and we currently have seminars scheduled through May 2022. To see a list of both the past and the future seminars (many with links to papers):

# Midwest Finance Association

I was the President of the MFA in 2017-2018 and I still have a soft spot for the organization, see [https://midwestfinance.org/](https://midwestfinance.org/). 

My [MFA Presidential address](https://midwestfinance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/presidential-address-march18.pdf) from San Antonio 2018 was about the impact of Machine Learning on finance. This is a topic of particular interest to me since [Is All That Talk Just Noise? The Information Content of Internet Stock Message Boards](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00662.x), 2004 **Journal of Finance** (with [Werner Antweiler](https://wernerantweiler.ca/)).
