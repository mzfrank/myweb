# Virtual Corporate Finance Seminars

In early 2020 due to Covid-19, some of us were concerned about the potential impact on academic seminars and conferences in corporate finance. As a result [Gordon Phillips (Dartmouth)](http://faculty.tuck.dartmouth.edu/gordon-phillips/), [Max Maksimovic (Maryland)](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/vojislav-max-maksimovic) and I, created a virtual weekly seminar series for corporate finance. It started May 2020. More than 40 papers have been presented so far, and we currently have seminars scheduled through May 18, 2022. To see a list of both the past and the future seminars (many with links to papers):
